## Details

This project uses Angular(11.x.x) and TensorFlow(2.x.x) and CNN(Convolution Neural Network) architecture and trained on MNIST Dataset.

## Code :code:

Use git clone to clone Client side code from github `https://github.com/shba007/Digit-Recognizer.git` and Server side code from heroku `https://git.heroku.com/digit-recognizer-ai.git`

## Folder :octocat:

There are basically 2 types of Folder one is Client(Browser) other one is Server. Client folder consist of angular files responsible of UI. Server folder has files to load TensorFlow model and predict on Node JS. I recommend to use a umbrella folder structure. A parent folder with project name and inside it client folder, server folder.

## Deploy :rocket:

The Client deployed in the Netlify platform check out the link [Digit Recognizer](https://digit-recognizer-ai.netlify.app)
